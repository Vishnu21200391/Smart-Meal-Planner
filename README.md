# -- Smart Meal Planner: A Ghibli Culinary Journey --

Embark on a magical meal-planning adventure inspired by the whimsical world of Studio Ghibli! This JavaFX application, crafted for MCA Semester II at Alliance University, transforms dietary preferences into delightful 7-day meal plans with nutritional insights. Adorned with a serene beige backdrop, vibrant green buttons, and warm brown text, it’s a visual treat completed on April 23, 2025. Explore the full story in our [project report (PDF)](docs/Java_Project_Report.pdf)!

## The Quest
Dive into a personalized culinary experience! Select your dietary path—Vegetarian, Low-Carb, or Balanced—and watch the planner weave a week of meals. Unravel nutritional mysteries with detailed breakdowns.

- **Enchanting Features**:
  - ✨ **Preference Portal**: Customize your diet and meal count (1-5), saved in a mystical JSON scroll.
  - 🍲 **Meal Spellbook**: Generates a 7-day feast, e.g., “Day 1: Breakfast - Oatmeal.”
  - 🔮 **Nutrition Oracle**: Reveals calories, carbs, protein, and fat with arcane precision.

## Arcane Tools
Forged with:
- **Java 17**: The sorcerer’s language of choice.
- **JavaFX 17.0.2**: Weaves the Ghibli-inspired GUI.
- **Maven**: The alchemist’s tool for dependency magic.
- **Gson 2.10.1**: Encodes the enchantment in JSON.

## Summon the App
Ready to cast the spell? Follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Realm**: `git clone https://github.com/Bellamkonda-Nokesh/Smart-Meal-Planner-Project.git`
2. **Install JDK 17**: Download from Oracle and set `JAVA_HOME`.
3. **Open in Eclipse**: Use the 2024-09 version, import as a Maven project.
4. **Run the Magic**: Right-click, Run As > Java Application, select `MainApp`.

## Behind the Scenes
This journey conquered challenges like JSON serialization and module system riddles, blending cutting-edge tech with Ghibli charm. The project is organized into four key domains: GUI design, data management, meal planning logic, and nutritional analysis, each housed in dedicated folders (`nokesh_ui`, `sai_data`, `Sagar_logic`, `satish_analysis`) for a collaborative masterpiece.
